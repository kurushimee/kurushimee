## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan Ermakov, an InfoSec student at SibSUTIS. I'm passionate about indie game development, and I've worked the most with Unity and Godot. Currently, I'm working on creating more of my personal projects, primarily using Unity. In the near future I plan on getting a job as a Unity developer.
