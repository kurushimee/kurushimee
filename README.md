## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan Ermakov, an InfoSec student at SibSUTIS. I'm passionate about game development, and it's my dream to be a good indie dev. Currently, I'm just trying to create more personal projects, as well as trying myself in more art stuff (primarily music).

You can check out my released games on itch.io: https://kurushimee.itch.io/
